# Inventory Simulation Project

## Overview
The Inventory Simulation project is a simulation program implemented in C# that allows you to simulate the management of one or more inventories. It helps you understand and analyze the inventory performance by considering various parameters such as the number of starting orders, lead days, demand distribution, and lead days distribution.

The simulation calculates the total number of days required to fulfill the desired number of orders, considering the lead days and demand distribution. The results are presented in a user-friendly UI interface.

## Prerequisites
- .NET Framework
- Visual Studio or any other C# development environment

## Installation
1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url`
2. Open the project in your C# development environment.
3. Build the project.
4. Run the program.

## Usage
1. Enter the starting number of orders for each inventory.
2. Specify the desired number of orders you want to fulfill.
3. Provide the lead days for each inventory.
4. Define the demand distribution.
5. Set the lead days distribution.
6. Click the "Run Simulation" button.
7. The program will display the total number of days required to fulfill the desired orders.

## User Interface
- Starting Number of Orders: Textboxes for initial orders.
- Desired Number of Orders: Textbox for target orders.
- Lead Days: Textboxes for lead days.
- Demand Distribution: Dropdown or input for demand distribution.
- Lead Days Distribution: Dropdown or input for lead days distribution.
- Run Simulation Button: Button to start the simulation.
- Results Display: Section to show total days for order fulfillment.
